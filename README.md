# Ario's Vimrc
---

Herein lies my .vimrc file - the list of commands that vim runs whenever I open a file with it.

I keep the file here so that I may use it accross different machines without having to remember the entire list(!).

## Notes
---

I do not pretend to be an expert in vim - indeed, I am not. Many of the commands found here are pulled from various pages accross the internet, and I would like to kindly thank the strangers who shared their knowledge so that others such as myself could benefit from it.
